# speech_recognition_bot_demo
Demo of Telegram bot that identifies the speaker in an audio recording and provides a cropped image of the celebrity's face along with their name. The bot uses a pre-trained speech recognition model from the SpeechBrain library to extract features from the audio, then classifies the speaker using a pre-trained encoder-classifier model also from SpeechBrain. The bot also utilizes OpenCV to extract frames from a corresponding YouTube video and crops the frame to focus on the identified speaker. Finally, the bot returns the name of the speaker and the cropped image to the user. The code provided in this repository demonstrates how to use these different tools and models to build a complete speaker identification system.
